           Hostel Online is a smartphone app designed to help campus students locate rooms with their desired preferences or 
           qualities as well as connect hostel managers to students.The application entirely bases on the differerent room qualities
           such as single or double,selfcontained or not,balcony view or no,basement floor or first floor etc.The application helps a 
           user to easily locate the most probable places they would choose if they were to move through different hostels with different 
           room qualities trying to make a choice.
         <p class="text">
          Hostel online will enable students to actually see the appearance of the rooms and this will provide them with 
          the overall description of the kind of room they are going to book.

            <h2 class="add-top-margin">Why Hostel Online?</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              If a hostel has a free room,How does it find a person to stay in it?
              Usually,students come and go as they check out the rooms and we don't have to ask anyone how ancient and resource taking this can be 
              both in terms of transport for the students and time for the managers.
              If a student needs to simply book a room,do they have to carry large sums of money with them?Should they even have to look for the 
              hostel manager to pay this money?Why not even do it at home?
              If a student is looking for these hostels particularly where do they find them?
              If a hostel manager simply needs the contact information of one of the students in his rooms,Where can he find that?
            </p>
           <p class="text">We realised that students often are presented with the hostels when they try to find accomodation 
             but never room details and this is what our app is about and to do this ofcourse we had to include the managers Who
             are to add these room details.
           </p>
            </p>
            <h2 class="add-top-margin">Who Can Use Hostel Online?</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="text">
           Hostel Online is available to every campus student looking for a hostel to book without having to waste alot of time checking out all the 
           differnt rooms in the hostels physically.The app helps you narrow down your choices of rooms making it easier for room selection and location 
           with the maps services.
           <p class="text">
            Hostel managers are free to subscribe to the app and add their hostel rooms if they are looking for a place to not only advertize their free 
            rooms but also keep track of the students in their rooms and the payments made.

            <h2 class="add-top-margin">Where was it developed?</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="text">
           Hostel Online was developed as a Recess Term Project at Makerere University College Of Computing And Information Technology in 2021.
           The project mainly focussed on helping makerere campus students select and find rooms around campus in the areas of kikoni,wandegeya and the 
           sorrounding.
           This would help reduce on the unnecessary movements students had to make while finding rooms.
           Freshers would also have a glimpse of the kind of rooms and prices they could afford.
